title: Surface with Trefoil Boundary

As naming suggests, the boundary curves we previously defined are actually boundaries to surfaces above and below our plane.

We can wrap these surfaces <mark style="color:#0074D9">inside</mark> and <mark style="color:#FF851B">outside</mark> the torus by our gluing transformations as before.

Notice that our rungs occur where the two surfaces join, and therefore are not actual boundaries to our fibration surface, which must be exactly the trefoil.

However, there appears to be a circular boundary on the outside surface away from the torus. To remove this as a boundary we identify these points, which we can visualize with stereographic projection.
